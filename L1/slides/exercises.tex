    \begin{block}{Area of Circle}
        Write a program that takes as input the length of the radius of a circle, and outputs its area.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Sum of First $N$ Natural Numbers}
        Write a program that takes as input an integer $N$, and computes the sum ($1+2+3+\cdots+N$).
        You may use the fact that $1+2+\cdots+N = \frac{N\cdot(N+1)}{2}$
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{}
        Write a program that takes as input an integer $N$, and computes the sum
        of the last three digits of $N$.
        If there are less than three digits, just sum all of them.

    \begin{block}{If you are familiar with C/C++}
        Write a program that takes as input an integer $N$, and computes the following sum.\\
        $\frac{6}{1^2}+\frac{6}{2^2}+\frac{6}{3^2}+\frac{6}{4^2}+\cdots+\frac{6}{N^2}$
